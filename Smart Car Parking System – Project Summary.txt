Smart Car Parking System ‚Äì Project Summary

Project Title:
Car Parking Syatem Using Arduino UNO

Overview:
This hardware mini project presents a smart car parking system using Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, a servo motor, LEDs, a buzzer, and an LCD display. It intelligently manages two parking slots, detects vehicle presence, controls gate access, calculates dynamic parking charges, and ensures safety through real-time feedback.

Key Features:

Dual-slot detection using ultrasonic sensors (We can increase)

Entry and exit monitoring via IR sensors

Servo-controlled gate barrier

Dynamic parking charge system (charges double every 10 seconds for demo purpose)

Real-time LCD updates of slot status and charges

Achievement:
üèÖ Won 2nd Prize in the Mini Hardware Project Exhibition in College for innovation, accuracy, and practical implementation.
